  <!-- Placeholder content -->
  <div class="empty-state" style="padding: 2rem;">
    ...placeholder text...
  </div>
  
  <!-- When ready, replace above with Google Form iframe: -->
</div>
```

### After:
```html
<div class="contact-form-container">
  <iframe

## Managing Responses

- Create pivot tables for analytics
- Use conditional formatting for priorities

Draft email templates for common requests:
```

Thank you for contacting CURB! 

[Response based on request type]

Best regards,
CURB Team
```

## Privacy & Data Protection

### Important Considerations:

1. **Inform users:** Add privacy notice to form description
   ```
   Privacy: Your information will only be used to respond to your inquiry 
   and will not be shared with third parties.
   ```

2. **Secure access:** 
   - Don't share the response sheet publicly
   - Only give access to trusted team members

3. **Data retention:**
   - Regularly archive old responses
   - Delete sensitive information when resolved

---

## Troubleshooting

### Form not displaying:
- Check iframe `src` URL is correct
- Verify form is set to "Anyone can respond"
- Check browser console for errors

### Form too small/large:
- Adjust `height` attribute in iframe
- Try values: 700, 800, 1000, 1200

### Not receiving notifications:
- Check Google Form settings
- Verify email notifications are enabled
- Check spam folder

### Responses not saving:
- Verify Google Sheets is linked
- Check you have edit access to the sheet
